# 🌫️ Air Quality Prediction using TensorFlow

This project is a machine learning-powered application that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using environmental pollution data. It leverages **TensorFlow** for deep learning and includes interactive data visualization with **Plotly**.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

- 🚀 Predicts AQI using pollutant data such as **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **NO₂**, **CO**, etc.
- 🧠 Trained on a dense neural network with TensorFlow (Keras API)
- 📊 Visualizes AQI trends and city-level pollution distribution
- 📁 Data source: `city_day.csv` (India pollution dataset)
✅ Note: Plotly charts are interactive and work perfectly in local environments like Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📊 Visualizations

- **AQI Trend Over Time**: Line chart grouped by city
- **AQI Distribution**: Box plot for comparison across cities

Plotly makes it interactive—you can zoom, hover, and explore the trends dynamically.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Loads and cleans the dataset (drops NaNs, formats dates)
2. Visualizes AQI trends and city distributions
3. Selects key pollutants as features
4. Trains a deep learning model with two hidden layers
5. Saves the model in `.keras` format
6. Makes predictions on custom user inputs

📌 Requirements:

Python 3.8+
TensorFlow
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Plotly
Matplotlib

⚙️ Future Scope

Deploy as a Flask web app or Streamlit dashboard
Integrate with live AQI APIs
Alert system based on thresholds
City-specific model tuning
